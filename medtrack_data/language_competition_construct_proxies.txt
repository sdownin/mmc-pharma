Vagueness
======================================


Hiller’s Communication Vagueness Dictionary, which contains 362 vague words and
expressions on 10 dimensions of vagueness (for a detailed description, see Hiller (2011)). 

The Hiller’s dictionary was originally developed to analyze
university lectures (Hiller, Marcotte, & Martin, 1969) but has since been widely used to detect
lack of clarity in communications in many other settings, such as program evaluations (e.g.,
Wilson & Wineburg, 1993), questionnaire designs (e.g., Ford, Stetz, Bott, & O'Leary, 2000),
political speeches (e.g., Hogenraad & Garagozov, 2014), and firms’ annual reports (e.g., Guo et
al., 2017).

LDA
======================================

structural topic modeling (STM) (Bail et al., 2017; Roberts et al., 2014; Schmiedel et al., 2018),

mixed methods approaches such as with critical discourse analysis to tie textual data analyzed using topic models with richer qualitative analysis (Vaara, Aranda, Etchanchu, Guyt, & Sele, 2019). 

Aggarwal, Lee, and Hwang (2017) used topic modeling to operationalize review diversity in Yelp 

Karanovic, Berends, and Engel (2018) used topic modeling to study actors’ perceptions of “platform capitalism” (Davis, 2016)

hierarchical LDA (hLDA) (Blei, Griffiths, & Jordan, 2010). While LDA traditionally requires that a researcher set the number of topics (the k parameter), hLDA can generate the optimal number of topics based on other researcher-defined parameters, such as the number of hierarchical levels and number of terms per topic. 

Tchalian, Glaser, Hannigan, and Lounsbury (2019) are using hLDA to identify the competing and complementary messaging efforts of stakeholders in the emergent electric vehicle (EV) industry.  ...Tchalian et al. (2019) to trace both the longitudinal appearance of different topics involved with the construction of the emergent EV category and their prominence within the discourse.  """"" This approach allows them to define the theoretical concept of
***“institutional attention”***—the field-level convergence that both isolates and aggregates the various interests involved in the social construction of the EV as a market category. """""

hierarchical arrangement of topics in their paper and others (e.g., Smith, Hawes, & Myers, 2014), reveals not only the primacy of ideas over time, but also the socio-cognitive meaning structures emphasized in cultural sociology (Mohr, 1998) and content analysis (Duriau et al., 2007), thus highlighting the great potential of topic modeling approaches for generating novel theoretical insights.
